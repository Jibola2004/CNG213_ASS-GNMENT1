# Patient Management System

This is a C-based **Patient Management System** designed to manage patient data, calculate BMI (Body Mass Index), and categorize patients based on their nutritional status (e.g., underweight, normal weight, obese). The program reads patient details from a file, stores them in a linked list, and sorts the list by first name. Features include adding new patients, searching for existing ones, and generating a separate list for "unhealthy" patients (e.g., obese).

## Key Features:
- Read patient data from a file (CSV format).
- Calculate and update nutritional status based on BMI.
- Store patient data in a linked list, sorted by first name.
- Add, search, and print patient records.
- Filter and manage a list of unhealthy patients.

## Technologies:
- C programming language
- Dynamic memory allocation using `malloc`
- File I/O for reading and writing patient data

## Usage:
1. Compile and run the program.
2. Provide a file containing patient data (CSV format).
3. The program will calculate BMI and categorize the nutritional status.
4. You can add, search, and filter patients based on their first name or nutritional status.
