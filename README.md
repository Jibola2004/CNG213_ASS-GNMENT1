his is a C-based Patient Management System designed to manage patient data, calculate BMI (Body Mass Index), and categorize patients based on their nutritional status (e.g., underweight, normal weight, obese). The program reads patient details from a file, stores them in a linked list, and sorts the list by first name. Features include adding new patients, searching for existing ones, and generating a separate list for "unhealthy" patients (e.g., obese).
